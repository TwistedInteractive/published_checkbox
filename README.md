Published Checkbox
1.0
===================

A checkbox that can be used for publishing.

It's very simple: it works just like a normal checkbox. BUT: When the user is logged in in the admin, the value used
for filtering and XML output will always be 'yes'.

This way, the editor can make an item (like a news article or something), and preview it in the live site without the
rest of the world to see.
